I am a Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience on full-stack web development.

Originally from Bolivia, I've been living in Germany since 2016.

I enjoy learning new stuff every day, and developing clever solutions to hard problems.

When Iâ€™m not writing code you can find me hitting the gym, traveling or having a beer with friends.
